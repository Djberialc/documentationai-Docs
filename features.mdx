## Document Creation and Editing Workflows

You start new documents directly in the editor, which supports MDX syntax for interactive components. The live preview updates as you type, ensuring WYSIWYG editing.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create New Doc" icon="plus">
    Navigate to your workspace and select `New Document`. Choose a template or start blank.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit with MDX" icon="edit">
    Use markdown with JSX components like `<Callout>` for richer content.

````mdx
<Callout kind="info">
  This is an inline callout in your MDX.
</Callout>
````

  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview and Publish" icon="eye">
    Toggle live preview, then hit `Publish` to make it live.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Search and Organization Tools

Powerful full-text search indexes all your docs. Organize with tags, categories, and nested navigation.

| Feature | Description | Benefit |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Global Search | Query across all docs | Find content in `<1s` |
| Tags | Add `{["api", "guide"]}` metadata | Filter by topic |
| Navigation Tree | Auto-generated sidebar | Easy browsing |

<Expandable title="Advanced Tagging" default-open="false">
  Use structured tags for better discoverability:

````javascript
const tags = {["feature", "bugfix", "api"]};
````

  Apply via frontmatter in your MDX files.
</Expandable>
