## Recent Updates

<Update label="2024-10-15" description="v1.2.0" tags={["feature", "bugfix"]}>

## New Features

````markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B[API Gateway]
    B --> C[Documentation Service]
    C --> D[Rendered Page]
```
````

- Introduced `<Columns>` component with up to 5 columns for better layout flexibility in feature grids and comparisons.

## Improvements

- Enhanced code block highlighting with new themes and better nested code support using 4-backtick fences.
- Optimized rendering performance for pages with multiple `<Tabs>` and `<Steps>` components.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed parsing errors caused by unescaped `{` and `}` characters in prose text.
- Resolved attribute quoting issues in JSX components, ensuring double quotes are enforced.
